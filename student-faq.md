# The Beman Project@GSoC: FAQ

## I want to know more about The Beman Project. Where should I start?

A good place to start is the [Beman Project website](https://bemanproject.org/), where we also share experiences and insights via the [blog](https://bemanproject.org/blog). For more context, see the [About Beman](https://bemanproject.org/2024/10/30/about-beman/) page.

You can reach the community through these channels:

* **[Website](https://bemanproject.org/)** — The Beman Project website and [blog](https://bemanproject.org/blog).
* **[GitHub](https://github.com/bemanproject)** — The Beman Project repositories: browse, build and run the libraries or the tooling.
* **[Discourse](https://discourse.bemanproject.org/)** — Project-wide discussions, library implementations, infrastructure, website and docs, blog comments. The official place to propose new GSoC ideas; when posting, **tag all people from this repo's [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS)** so they can follow and respond.
* **[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BKpNyJgSbm)** — There is a [**#gsoc** channel](https://discord.com/channels/1457903855898460405/1470578839540465970) for GSoC-related questions, project ideas and mentors.

The community is ready to help: ask questions, discuss project ideas and get in touch with mentors.

## What to expect from mentors during GSoC?

Your mentors are the people you will interact with the most during your project; your guides and the ones that will solidify your integration into the organization.
They are also the people that will pass/fail you, so communicating with them not only regarding your issues, but your success too, should be on your TODO list.

## What are the midterm evaluations? What about the final evaluations?

They are key stages in your project. They require feedback from both the mentor and the mentee and they determine the status of your project; they also represent a great way for the mentor to decide whether your work will end successfully, therefore (potentially) integrating it.

As stated earlier, both evaluations are a pass/fail from the mentors, so mark the dates in your calendar. They are important!

## What should I be doing during the community bonding period?

As the name suggests, you should get to know the people you'll work with, the maintainers, the core, people that previously built the part of The Beman Project you're working on.

You should, also, (if you haven't already), get accustomed to building and testing the libraries or the tooling and come up with a roadmap for the 12+ weeks that you'll have for your idea.

We strongly suggest you attend any community gatherings or meetings where we discuss ideas, issues, PRs and other fun stuff.

## Is making a contribution necessary in order to apply to The Beman Project?

Theoretically, you can apply without making a contribution, however, we believe that having even a small contribution proves that you are, indeed, not only ready, but willing to contribute to open source code.

For ideas, visit the issue pages for [The Beman Project repositories](https://github.com/bemanproject) on GitHub. Look for items marked with `good first issue` or similar labels if available.

Take a look into documentation and tests as well; there's always work to be done when maintaining a project of this kind.

Feeling lucky? Try fixing some build warnings or adding tests. There's plenty of them, waiting just for you!

## Can I propose my own idea for a project?

If you have a project in mind, you are welcome to discuss it with the community members. However, the project needs to be approved by the [Beman Project Leads](https://github.com/orgs/bemanproject/teams/project-leads) (check the [Governance](https://github.com/bemanproject/beman/blob/main/docs/governance.md) for more information).

## How do I prepare my proposal?

1. Start looking into the organization way before the Contributor Proposal Period, do not wait for the last week to start the investigation process.

2. Take a good look at the `gsoc-${year}/ideas.md` file, choose a topic based on your current knowledge and begin browsing the web.

3. Join [Discourse](https://discourse.bemanproject.org/) and [The Beman Project's Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/BKpNyJgSbm); use the [**#gsoc** channel](https://discord.com/channels/1457903855898460405/1470578839540465970) to ask questions! It's extremely important to be as active as possible.

4. Read the `gsoc-${year}/README.md` for the year you are applying in. It contains critical information regarding the whole process, especially the proposal template.

5. Write your proposal. Get feedback from the community.
