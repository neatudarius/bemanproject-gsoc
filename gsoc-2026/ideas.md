## The Beman Project Ideas

Thank you for your interest in participating in [Google Summer of Code 2026 (GSoC26)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2026)!

The Beman Project is a modern C++ libraries initiative: "Tomorrow's C++ Standard Libraries Today!"
It hosts implementations targeting current and upcoming C++ standards, including proposals for the C++ standard library and related tooling.
Contributing here means working on production-quality C++, standards alignment, and open source library development.
