## Introduction

Make your way into open-source development with C++ standards, modern libraries and cutting-edge tooling. Apply to [GSoC26](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) with the [Beman Project](https://bemanproject.org/).

[Google Summer of Code 2026](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC'26) is a global online program focused on bringing new contributors into open-source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open-source organization, such as The Beman Project, on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.

The [Beman Project](https://bemanproject.org/) is a modern C++ libraries initiative: "Tomorrow's C++ Standard Libraries Today!"
It hosts implementations targeting current and upcoming C++ standards (C++26, C++29), including proposals for [std::optional extensions](https://github.com/bemanproject/optional), [std::execution](https://github.com/bemanproject/execution), upcoming scope guard, etc.

Before you apply, see the [GSoC contributor eligibility](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started).

## How to apply

Follow these steps to apply (details in [student-faq.md](../student-faq.md)):
1. Connect to the community.
2. Get accustomed to The Beman Project's development ecosystem.
3. Make a small contribution. Try more than one if you are curious.
4. Decide on a GSoC project.
5. Fill out an application.

### 1. Connect to the community

We encourage you to join our platforms as described in [student-faq.md](../student-faq.md#i-want-to-know-more-about-the-beman-project-where-should-i-start): Discourse, Discord, GitHub, etc.

### 2. Get accustomed to The Beman Project's development ecosystem

Beman Project development happens on [The Beman Project GitHub organization](https://github.com/bemanproject).

For starters, check the following resources:

* https://bemanproject.org — The Beman Project website and [blog](https://bemanproject.org/blog).
* https://github.com/bemanproject — The Beman Project repositories: browse, build and run the libraries or the tooling.
* https://github.com/bemanproject/beman — The place where guides, policies and more are documented (e.g., [The Beman Standard](https://github.com/bemanproject/beman/blob/main/docs/beman_standard.md)).
* https://github.com/bemanproject/exemplar — An exemplar project for Beman libraries (used as a template library for new Beman libraries).
* Actual libraries: check [Beman Libraries](https://bemanproject.org/libraries) on our website.

See the contributing guidelines in each repository. Build, run and test the libraries to get hands-on with the codebase.

### 3. Make a small contribution. Try more than one if you are curious.

The best way to prepare your application is to make small contributions.

First off, browse the contribution guidelines for the repositories you are interested in.
Then aim for small, easy to do contributions, such as:

* Fixing build warnings or improving tests in Beman libraries repositories (e.g., by running `beman-tidy`, sanitizers, linters, etc.).
* Fixing inconsistencies or adding missing information in documentation. Add more code examples.
* Addressing issues marked with `good-first-issue` or similar labels (also, *update with actual labels*).

### 4. Decide on a GSoC project

We put together a [list of project ideas](https://github.com/bemanproject/gsoc/blob/main/gsoc-2026/ideas.md) that you can choose from.

Note that this is not an exclusive list. You can suggest new project ideas to The Beman Project GSoC mentors on the community channels. If your idea has been vetted by a mentor (or more) in the community, you can submit it as part of your application.

If you fancy a given project idea, the **official** place to propose and follow the discussion is [Discourse](https://discourse.bemanproject.org/).
* When posting about a new or chosen project idea on Discourse, **tag all people listed in this repo's [CODEOWNERS](../.github/CODEOWNERS)** so they can follow and respond.
* You can also ask for extra help on the [**#gsoc** channel](https://discord.com/channels/1457903855898460405/1470578839540465970) on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BKpNyJgSbm).

A mentor will reply and give you extra information. If that is indeed a project you want to work on, you can submit it as part of your application.

### 5. Fill out an application

Once the application period has opened (in the March 16 - March 31, 2026 period), you have to submit your application on the [Google Summer of Code website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
Your application must be written in English.
It should contain a detailed description of your project proposal.

The application is a document that you will submit and that summarizes your motivation and suitability for the project.
We recommend you use our proposal template (*link to Google Doc or Markdown template when available*) and make sure you answer all the questions.

## Our Beman@GSoC AI policy <a id="our-beman-gsoc-ai-policy"></a>

We recognize the usefulness of AI tools in understanding code, debugging, developing, and writing documentation.
Whenever useful, use AI to assist in understanding tasks, localizing bugs and creating solutions.

However, we mandate that any contribution must be thoroughly understood and reviewed by its author.
We do not consider a true contributor someone that has used AI tools for a contribution but has imperfect understanding of the contribution.

For the actual application submission, your only reliance on AI should be on improving wording.
The application idea, objectives, motivation of work, planning must be owned by you, the applicant.
Heavy use of AI for the application will disqualify your application.

## Still have some doubts/questions? Reach out to the community

Ask away on [Discourse](https://discourse.bemanproject.org/) (tag all people listed in this repo's [CODEOWNERS](../.github/CODEOWNERS)) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BKpNyJgSbm), on the [**#gsoc** channel](https://discord.com/channels/1457903855898460405/1470578839540465970).
