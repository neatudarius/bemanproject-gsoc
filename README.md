# The Beman Project at Google Summer of Code

This repository contains the official archive of [The Beman Project's](https://bemanproject.org/) GSoC projects over the years.

## File hierarchy

Browse the files to investigate what work was done every year, expectations, ideas and more:

```
gsoc/
|---gsoc-${year}/
|   |---ideas.md
|   |---README.md
|   |---work-product/
|   |   |---${FirstnameLastname}--${ProjectFullName}/
|---README.md
|---student-work-product-template.md
|---student-faq.md
```

Let's take a tour of what every file in this hierarchy means:

* For every year, we provided an updated list of ideas that should inspire you to decide what you'd like to work on during summer, the `ideas.md` file.
You can choose from there or you can come up with your own idea; nevertheless, get involved with the community and debate on your project.

* The `README.md` inside the yearly directory contains information specific to the year we are participating in GSoC: general code of conduct, the proposal template and what is expected of you **before** being accepted as a contributor.

* Now, onto the `work-product` directory: this is the place where we document what our contributors have worked on during the summer, their progress and more.
Each contributor's work lives in a folder named `${FirstnameLastname}--${ProjectFullName}/` (e.g. `DariusNeațu--StdOptionalC++26Extensions`).
It's also where you will post your work (if you are going to be accepted as a contributor) and it will be what your mentor will revise before giving their final feedback.

* The root `README.md` is what you are reading now: Beman awesome stuff!

* The root `student-work-product-template.md` file contains the skeleton that accepted contributors use for their final submission.

* The root [**student-faq.md**](student-faq.md) file answers common questions about GSoC, how to prepare your proposal, The Beman Project, mentors, evaluations and more.

## Community

We have two principal audiences: **Library Developers** and the **C++ community**. We want to allow Library Developers to have a clear path on the road to Standardization. And we want to make it easy for the C++ community to use these libraries to ensure we have real-world usage.

To achieve this, The Beman Project creates and makes available to the entire C++ community cutting-edge technologies: Docker images with the latest versions of major compilers, reusable infrastructure to build a C++ library ready for standardization from scratch, process automation, boundary push for C++ modules, benchmarking tools, and more.

* **[Discourse](https://discourse.bemanproject.org/)** — For project-wide discussions, library implementations, infrastructure, website and docs, and blog comments.
* **[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BKpNyJgSbm)** — There is a [**#gsoc** channel](https://discord.com/channels/1457903855898460405/1470578839540465970) where you can ask questions, discuss project ideas and get in touch with mentors.
* **[GitHub](https://github.com/bemanproject)** — The Beman Project repositories.
* **[Website](https://bemanproject.org/)** — The Beman Project website where we also share our experiences and insights via the [blog](https://bemanproject.org/blog).

## Best practices

* First and foremost, read the `gsoc-${year}/README.md` file for the year you are applying in.
Follow the steps documented there as closely as possible: you (literally) get extra points.

* Read the [**student-faq.md**](student-faq.md) for common questions (evaluations, mentors, proposal, community).

* Inspect `gsoc-${year}/ideas.md`.

* Get involved with the community regarding your project idea! Use our community channels to discuss. 

* Take a glance at the `gsoc-${year}/work-product` directory: know what to expect after the summer ends, what previous mentees had to do and their involvement with the Beman Project.

* Write your proposal, you'll find the template linked in the `gsoc-${year}/README.md` for the year you are applying in.

* Submit your proposal and good luck!
